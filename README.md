# VisualControlTooling
some stuff I use to control software that don't have API or command line interfaces

the gist of it is to make a "template" which is a cropped screenshot of the part you cant to clic, information
about that 'template' are store in its filename. tools/template_maker_horizontal_screenshot.py can be used to
make templates with a gui

It allow to make machine vision automation for any program very fast.

yeah the code is dirty, this is code I've been  writing for the past 15 years, taking refactor upon refactor, 
done in a rush when I most need it

# core
everything needed to automate using machine vision

# gcs_bot
example of an automation of the software gemcut studio, will load a diagram and save the rendered gem + chart

# tools
some tools for finding good HSV bounds, making templates, taking a screenshot of a screen
